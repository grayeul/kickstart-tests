# classify-sync-with-repo

The scripts/classify-failures.yml contains two lists of issues. issues list should contain only the repository issues that are open, the closed_issues list should contain only the repository issues that are closed. Can you check with the repository issues and suggest a patch for the classify-failures.yml file that would reflect current state of the repository issues?
